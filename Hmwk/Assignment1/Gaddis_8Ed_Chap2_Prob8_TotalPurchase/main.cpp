 * Purpose:  
 * 8. A customer in a store is purchasing five items. 
 * The prices of the five items are: 
 * Price of item 1 = $15.95 
 * Price of item 2 = $24.95 
 * Price of item 3 = $6.95 
 * Price of item 4 = $12.95 
 * Price of item 5 = $3.95 
 * Write a program that holds the prices of the five 
 * items in five variables. 
 * Display each itemâ€™s price, the subtotal of the sale, 
 * the amount of sales tax, and the total. 
 * Assume the sales tax is 7%.
