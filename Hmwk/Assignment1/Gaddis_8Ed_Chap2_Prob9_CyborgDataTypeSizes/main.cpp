 * Purpose:  
 * 9. You have been given a job as a programmer 
 * on a Cyborg supercomputer. In order to accomplish 
 * some calculations, you need to know how many bytes 
 * the following data types use:  char,  int,  float, 
 * and  double . You do not have any manuals, so you canâ€™t 
 * look this information up. Write a C++ program that will 
 * determine the amount of memory used by these types and 
 * display the information on the screen.
